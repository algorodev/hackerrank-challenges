# Compare The Triplets

Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

- If a[i] > b[i], then 1 point for the first one.
- If a[i] < b[i], then 1 point for the second one.
- If a[i] = b[i], then neither receives a point.

Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

Given a and b, determine their respective comparison points.
